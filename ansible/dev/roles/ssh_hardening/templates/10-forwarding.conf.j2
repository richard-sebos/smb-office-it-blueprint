## 10-forwarding.conf
# ---------------------------------------------
# Disable All SSH Forwarding and Tunneling
# ---------------------------------------------

# Disables TCP port forwarding to prevent users from creating encrypted tunnels
# that could be used to bypass firewalls or access internal services.
AllowTcpForwarding no

# Disables Unix domain socket forwarding (e.g., for interprocess communication).
# Adds an additional layer of restriction for local stream forwarding.
AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# Prevents forwarding of the SSH authentication agent.
# Protects against credential theft via agent hijacking on shared systems.
AllowAgentForwarding no

# Disables creation of VPN-like tunnels using SSH.
# Helps enforce strict network boundaries and prevent lateral movement.
PermitTunnel no

# Prevents binding forwarded ports to non-loopback addresses (e.g., 0.0.0.0),
# which could expose services to external networks if port forwarding were enabled.
GatewayPorts no

# Disables X11 forwarding to block graphical interface redirection over SSH,
# reducing risk of remote GUI attacks or accidental exposure.
X11Forwarding no
